## Debugging

- If you're on Windows and the network connection is failing, follow [this article](https://medium.com/@hariroshanmail/how-to-run-react-native-project-in-windows-10-and-using-iphone-after-latest-expo-update-307f3d43f850) to give your device access to the port. Make sure to use the port 19000 instead of 1443. If this still doesn't work, try [this](https://medium.com/@colin_78999/solving-network-response-timed-out-when-using-expo-on-windows-b486c22d5584) article.
